## Methodology

This analysis was conducted using advanced data science techniques:

- **Data Source**: Linnaean-inspired Robot Taxonomy V2 framework
- **Analysis Tools**: Python with pandas, plotly, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- **Visualization**: High-quality static PNG images (300 DPI minimum)
- **Classification**: Hierarchical taxonomy with domain, class, order, and sector levels
- **Image Quality**: All figures saved at 1600px width with professional typography

## Technical Specifications

- **Image Format**: PNG with transparent backgrounds where appropriate
- **Resolution**: 300 DPI minimum for print quality
- **Dimensions**: Optimized for A4 printing and digital display
- **Color Scheme**: Professional color palettes with accessibility considerations
- **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts suitable for both screen and print

## Data Quality Notes

- Some robots may have incomplete temporal or geographic data
- Classification is based on the new framework which may differ from traditional categorizations
- Regional mapping uses standardized country codes where available
- All visualizations are static images suitable for documentation and printing

## Recommendations

1. **Temporal Analysis**: Focus on recent trends (post-2015) for current market insights
2. **Regional Analysis**: Consider cultural and economic factors when analyzing geographic patterns
3. **Classification**: Use the hierarchical structure for detailed categorization needs
4. **Future Research**: Investigate correlations between geographic location and robot specialization
5. **Documentation**: All PNG images can be used directly in presentations and reports
