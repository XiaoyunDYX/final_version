It plays important roles in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory, and in spatial memory that enables navigation. In humans and other primates, the hippocampus is located in the archicortex, one of the three regions of allocortex, in each hemisphere. The hippocampus is a structure found in all vertebrates.
